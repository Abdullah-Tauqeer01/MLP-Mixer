
# MLP-Mixer: An all-MLP Architecture for Vision

## Overview

MLP-Mixer proposes a simple yet effective all-MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) architecture for image classification tasks, deviating from conventional CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and attention-based models. The architecture relies exclusively on MLPs, using two types of layers: channel-mixing MLPs and token-mixing MLPs, facilitating communication between different features and spatial locations, respectively. This architecture has demonstrated competitive performance on various image classification benchmarks while maintaining efficiency in pre-training and inference costs.

## Architecture

- **Input**: The model accepts a sequence of linearly projected image patches.
- **Mixer Layers**: Composed of token-mixing MLPs (mix spatial information) and channel-mixing MLPs (mix per-location features), with skip-connections, dropout, and layer normalization.
- **Output**: Employs global average pooling followed by a fully-connected layer for classification.

## Performance

MLP-Mixer achieves near state-of-the-art performance on image classification tasks, with significant improvements when trained on large datasets or with modern regularization schemes. The model has shown to be competitive with both CNNs and Transformer-based models, especially in scenarios involving large-scale datasets.

## Dataset and Pre-training

- **Datasets**: ILSVRC2012 ImageNet, ImageNet-21k, and JFT-300M were used for evaluating the performance.
- **Pre-training Setup**: Models were pre-trained using Adam optimizer, with specific settings for learning rate, weight decay, and other hyperparameters optimized for each dataset.
